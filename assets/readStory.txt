One September night a family had gathered round their hearth, and piled it high with the driftwood of mountain streams, the dry cones of the pine, and the splintered ruins of great trees that had come crashing down the precipice. Up the chimney roared the fire, and brightened the room with its broad blaze. The faces of the father and mother had a sober gladness; the children laughed; the eldest daughter was the image of Happiness at seventeen; and the aged grandmother, who sat knitting in the warmest place, was the image of Happiness grown old. They had found the "herb, heart's-ease," in the bleakest spot of all New England. This family were situated in the Notch of the White Hills, where the wind was sharp throughout the year, and pitilessly cold in the winter--giving their cottage all its fresh inclemency before it descended on the valley of the Saco. They dwelt in a cold spot and a dangerous one; for a mountain towered above their heads, so steep, that the stones would often rumble down its sides and startle them at midnight.
The daughter had just uttered some simple jest that filled them all with mirth, when the wind came through the Notch and seemed to pause before their cottage--rattling the door, with a sound of wailing and lamentation, before it passed into the valley. For a moment it saddened them, though there was nothing unusual in the tones. But the family were glad again when they perceived that the latch was lifted by some traveller, whose footsteps had been unheard amid the dreary blast which heralded his approach, and wailed as he was entering, and went moaning away from the door.
Though they dwelt in such a solitude, these people held daily converse with the world. The romantic pass of the Notch is a great artery, through which the life-blood of internal commerce is continually throbbing between Maine, on one side, and the Green Mountains and the shores of the St. Lawrence, on the other. The stage-coach always drew up before the door of the cottage. The way-farer, with no companion but his staff, paused here to exchange a word, that the sense of loneliness might not utterly overcome him ere he could pass through the cleft of the mountain, or reach the first house in the valley. And here the teamster, on his way to Portland market, would put up for the night; and, if a bachelor, might sit an hour beyond the usual bedtime, and steal a kiss from the mountain maid at parting. It was one of those primitive taverns where the traveller pays only for food and lodging, but meets with a homely kindness beyond all price. When the footsteps were heard, therefore, between the outer door and the inner one, the whole family rose up, grandmother, children, and all, as if about to welcome someone who belonged to them, and whose fate was linked with theirs.
The door was opened by a young man. His face at first wore the melancholy expression, almost despondency, of one who travels a wild and bleak road, at nightfall and alone, but soon brightened up when he saw the kindly warmth of his reception. He felt his heart spring forward to meet them all, from the old woman, who wiped a chair with her apron, to the little child that held out its arms to him. One glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent familiarity with the eldest daughter.
"Ah, this fire is the right thing!" cried he; "especially when there is such a pleasant circle round it. I am quite benumbed; for the Notch is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows; it has blown a terrible blast in my face all the way from Bartlett."
"Then you are going towards Vermont?" said the master of the house, as he helped to take a light knapsack off the young man's shoulders.
"Yes; to Burlington, and far enough beyond," replied he. "I meant to have been at Ethan Crawford's tonight; but a pedestrian lingers along such a road as this. It is no matter; for, when I saw this good fire, and all your cheerful faces, I felt as if you had kindled it on purpose for me, and were waiting my arrival. So I shall sit down among you, and make myself at home."
The frank-hearted stranger had just drawn his chair to the fire when something like a heavy footstep was heard without, rushing down the steep side of the mountain, as with long and rapid strides, and taking such a leap in passing the cottage as to strike the opposite precipice. The family held their breath, because they knew the sound, and their guest held his by instinct.
"The old mountain has thrown a stone at us, for fear we should forget him," said the landlord, recovering himself. "He sometimes nods his head and threatens to come down; but we are old neighbors, and agree together pretty well upon the whole. Besides we have a sure place of refuge hard by if he should be coming in good earnest."
Let us now suppose the stranger to have finished his supper of bear's meat; and, by his natural felicity of manner, to have placed himself on a footing of kindness with the whole family, so that they talked as freely together as if he belonged to their mountain brood. He was of a proud, yet gentle spirit--haughty and reserved among the rich and great; but ever ready to stoop his head to the lowly cottage door, and be like a brother or a son at the poor man's fireside. In the household of the Notch he found warmth and simplicity of feeling, the pervading intelligence of New England, and a poetry of native growth, which they had gathered when they little thought of it from the mountain peaks and chasms, and at the very threshold of their romantic and dangerous abode. He had travelled far and alone; his whole life, indeed, had been a solitary path; for, with the lofty caution of his nature, he had kept himself apart from those who might otherwise have been his companions. The family, too, though so kind and hospitable, had that consciousness of unity among themselves, and separation from the world at large, which, in every domestic circle, should still keep a holy place where no stranger may intrude. But this evening a prophetic sympathy impelled the refined and educated youth to pour out his heart before the simple mountaineers, and constrained them to answer him with the same free confidence. And thus it should have been. Is not the kindred of a common fate a closer tie than that of birth?
The secret of the young man's character was a high and abstracted ambition. He could have borne to live an undistinguished life, but not to be forgotten in the grave. Yearning desire had been transformed to hope; and hope, long cherished, had become like certainty, that, obscurely as he journeyed now, a glory was to beam on all his pathway-though not, perhaps, while he was treading it. But when posterity should gaze back into the gloom of what was now the present, they would trace the brightness of his footsteps, brightening as meaner glories faded, and confess that a gifted one had passed from his cradle to his tomb with none to recognize him.
"As yet," cried the stranger--his cheek glowing and his eye flashing with enthusiasm--"as yet, I have done nothing. Were I to vanish from the earth tomorrow, none would know so much of me as you: that a nameless youth came up at nightfall from the valley of the Saco, and opened his heart to you in the evening, and passed through the Notch by sunrise, and was seen no more. Not a soul would ask, 'Who was he? Whither did the wanderer go?' But I cannot die till I have achieved my destiny. Then, let Death come! I shall have built my monument!"
There was a continual flow of natural emotion, gushing forth amid abstracted reverie, which enabled the family to understand this young man's sentiments, though so foreign from their own. With quick sensibility of the ludicrous, he blushed at the ardor into which he had been betrayed.
"You laugh at me," said he, taking the eldest daughter's hand, and laughing himself. "You think my ambition as nonsensical as if I were to freeze myself to death on the top of Mount Washington, only that people might spy at me from the country round about. And, truly, that would be a noble pedestal for a man's statue!"
"It is better to sit here by this fire," answered the girl, blushing, "and be comfortable and contented, though nobody thinks about us."
"I suppose," said her father, after a fit of musing, "there is something natural in what the young man says; and if my mind had been turned that way, I might have felt just the same. It is strange, wife, how his talk has set my head running on things that are pretty certain never to come to pass."
"Perhaps they may," observed the wife. "Is the man thinking what he will do when he is a widower?"
"No, no!" cried he, repelling the idea with reproachful kindness. "When I think of your death, Esther, I think of mine, too. But I was wishing we had a good farm in Bartlett, or Bethlehem, or Littleton, or some other township round the White Mountains; but not where they could tumble on our heads. I should want to stand well with my neighbors and be called Squire, and sent to General Court for a term or two; for a plain, honest man may do as much good there as a lawyer. And when I should be grown quite an old man, and you an old woman, so as not to be long apart, I might die happy enough in my bed, and leave you all crying around me. A slate gravestone would suit me as well as a marble one--with just my name and age, and a verse of a hymn, and something to let people know that I lived an honest man and died a Christian."
"There now!" exclaimed the stranger; "it is our nature to desire a monument, be it slate or marble, or a pillar of granite, or a glorious memory in the universal heart of man."
"We're in a strange way, tonight," said the wife, with tears in her eyes. "They say it's a sign of something, when folks' minds go a-wandering so. Hark to the children!"
They listened accordingly. The younger children had been put to bed in another room, but with an open door between, so that they could be heard talking busily among themselves. One and all seemed to have caught the infection from the fireside circle, and were outvying each other in wild wishes, and childish projects, of what they would do when they came to be men and women. At length a little boy, instead of addressing his brothers and sisters, called out to his mother.
"I'll tell you what I wish, mother," cried he. "I want you and father and grandma'm, and all of us, and the stranger too, to start right away, and go and take a drink out of the basin of the Flume!"
Nobody could help laughing at the child's notion of leaving a warm bed, and dragging them from a cheerful fire, to visit the basin of the Flume--a brook, which tumbles over the precipice, deep within the Notch. The boy had hardly spoken when a wagon rattled along the road, and stopped a moment before the door. It appeared to contain two or three men, who were cheering their hearts with the rough chorus of a song, which resounded, in broken notes, between the cliffs, while the singers hesitated whether to continue their journey or put up here for the night.
"Father," said the girl, "they are calling you by name."
But the good man doubted whether they had really called him, and was unwilling to show himself too solicitous of gain by inviting people to patronize his house. He therefore did not hurry to the door; and the lash being soon applied, the travellers plunged into the Notch, still singing and laughing, though their music and mirth came back drearily from the heart of the mountain.
"There, mother!" cried the boy, again. "They'd have given us a ride to the Flume."
Again they laughed at the child's pertinacious fancy for a night ramble. But it happened that a light cloud passed over the daughter's spirit; she looked gravely into the fire, and drew a breath that was almost a sigh. It forced its way, in spite of a little struggle to repress it. Then starting and blushing, she looked quickly round the circle, as if they had caught a glimpse into her bosom. The stranger asked what she had been thinking of.
"Nothing," answered she, with a downcast smile. "Only I felt lonesome just then."
"Oh, I have always had a gift of feeling what is in other people's hearts," said he, half seriously. "Shall I tell the secrets of yours? For I know what to think when a young girl shivers by a warm hearth, and complains of lonesomeness at her mother's side. Shall I put these feelings into words?"
"They would not be a girl's feelings any longer if they could be put into words," replied the mountain nymph, laughing, but avoiding his eye.

All this was said apart. Perhaps a germ of love was springing in their hearts, so pure that it might blossom in Paradise, since it could not be matured on earth; for women worship such gentle dignity as his; and the proud, contemplative, yet kindly soul is oftenest captivated by simplicity like hers. But while they spoke softly, and he was watching the happy sadness, the lightsome shadows, the shy yearnings of a maiden's nature, the wind through the Notch took a deeper and drearier sound. It seemed, as the fanciful stranger said, like the choral strain of the spirits of the blast, who in old Indian times had their dwelling among these mountains, and made their heights and recesses a sacred region.
There was a wail along the road, as if a funeral were passing. To chase away the gloom, the family threw pine branches on their fire, till the dry leaves crackled and the flame arose, discovering once again a scene of peace and humble happiness. The light hovered about them fondly, and caressed them all. There were the little faces of the children, peeping from their bed apart, and here the father's frame of strength, the mother's subdued and careful mien, the high-browed youth, the budding girl, and the good old grandam, still knitting in the warmest place. The aged woman looked up from her task, and, with fingers ever busy, was the next to speak.
"Old folks have their notions," said she, "as well as young ones. You've been wishing and planning; and letting your heads run on one thing and another, till you've set my mind a-wandering too. Now what should an old woman wish for, when she can go but a step or two before she comes to her grave? Children, it will haunt me night and day till I tell you."
"What is it, mother?" cried the husband and wife at once.
Then the old woman, with an air of mystery which drew the circle closer round the fire, informed them that she had provided her grave-clothes some years before--a nice linen shroud, a cap with a muslin ruff, and everything of a finer sort than she had worn since her wedding day. But this evening an old superstition had strangely recurred to her. It used to be said, in her younger days, that if anything were amiss with a corpse, if only the ruff were not smooth, or the cap did not set right, the corpse in the coffin and beneath the clods would strive to put up its cold hands and arrange it. The bare thought made her nervous.
"Don't talk so, grandmother!" said the girl, shuddering.
"Now," continued the old woman, with singular earnestness, yet smiling strangely at her own folly, "I want one of you, my children- when your mother is dressed and in the coffin--I want one of you to hold a looking-glass over my face. Who knows but I may take a glimpse at myself, and see whether all's right?"
"Old and young, we dream of graves and monuments," murmured the stranger youth. "I wonder how mariners feel when the ship is sinking, and they, unknown and undistinguished, are to be buried together in the ocean--that wide and nameless sepulchre?"
For a moment, the old woman's ghastly conception so engrossed the minds of her hearers that a sound abroad in the night, rising like the roar of a blast, had grown broad, deep, and terrible, before the fated group were conscious of it. The house and all within it trembled; the foundations of the earth seemed to be shaken, as if this awful sound were the peal of the last trump. Young and old exchanged one wild glance, and remained an instant, pale, affrighted, without utterance, or power to move. Then the same shriek burst simultaneously from all their lips.
"The Slide! The Slide!"
The simplest words must intimate, but not portray, the unutterable horror of the catastrophe. The victims rushed from their cottage, and sought refuge in what they deemed a safer spot--where, in contemplation of such an emergency, a sort of barrier had been reared. Alas! they had quitted their security, and fled right into the pathway of destruction. Down came the whole side of the mountain, in a cataract of ruin. Just before it reached the house, the stream broke into two branches--shivered not a window there, but overwhelmed the whole vicinity, blocked up the road, and annihilated everything in its dreadful course. Long ere the thunder of the great Slide had ceased to roar among the mountains, the mortal agony had been endured, and the victims were at peace. Their bodies were never found.
The next morning, the light smoke was seen stealing from the cottage chimney up the mountain side. Within, the fire was yet smouldering on the hearth, and the chairs in a circle round it, as if the inhabitants had but gone forth to view the devastation of the Slide, and would shortly return, to thank Heaven for their miraculous escape. All had left separate tokens, by which those who had known the family were made to shed a tear for each. Who has not heard their name? The story has been told far and wide, and will forever be a legend of these mountains. Poets have sung their fate.
There were circumstances which led some to suppose that a stranger had been received into the cottage on this awful night, and had shared the catastrophe of all its inmates. Others denied that there were sufficient grounds for such a conjecture. Wo for the high-souled youth, with his dream of Earthly Immortality! His name and person utterly unknown; his history, his way of life, his plans, a mystery never to be solved, his death and his existence equally a doubt! Whose was the agony of that death moment?

Story:2 :
It was raining as I got off the train in Nashville, Tennessee -- a slow, gray rain. I was tired so I went straight to my hotel.

A big, heavy man was walking up and down in the hotel lobby. Something about the way he moved made me think of a hungry dog looking for a bone. He had a big, fat, red face and a sleepy expression in his eyes. He introduced himself as Wentworth Caswell -- Major Wentworth Caswell -- from "a fine southern family."  Caswell pulled me into the hotels barroom and yelled for a waiter. We ordered drinks. While we drank, he talked continually about himself, his family, his wife and her family. He said his wife was rich. He showed me a handful of silver coins that he pulled from his coat pocket.

By this time, I had decided that I wanted no more of him. I said good night.

I went up to my room and looked out the window. It was ten oclock but the town was silent. "A nice quiet place," I said to myself as I got ready for bed. Just an ordinary, sleepy southern town."

I was born in the south myself. But I live in New York now. I write for a large magazine. My boss had asked me to go to Nashville. The magazine had received some stories and poems from a writer in Nashville, named Azalea Adair. The editor liked her work very much. The publisher asked me to get her to sign an agreement to write only for his magazine.

I left the hotel at nine oclock the next morning to find Miss Adair. It was still raining.  As soon as I stepped outside I met Uncle Caesar. He was a big, old black man with fuzzy gray hair.

Uncle Caesar was wearing the strangest coat I had ever seen. It must have been a military officers coat. It was very long and when it was new it had been gray. But now rain, sun and age had made it a rainbow of colors. Only one of the buttons was left. It was yellow and as big as a fifty cent coin.

Uncle Caesar stood near a horse and carriage. He opened the carriage door and said softly, "Step right in, sir. Ill take you anywhere in the city."

"I want to go to eight-sixty-one Jasmine Street," I said, and I started to climb into the carriage. But the old man stopped me. "Why do you want to go there, sir? "

"What business is it of yours?" I said angrily. Uncle Caesar relaxed and smiled. "Nothing, sir. But its a lonely part of town. Just step in and Ill take you there right away."

Eight-sixty-one Jasmine Street had been a fine house once, but now it was old and dying. I got out of the carriage.

"That will be two dollars, sir," Uncle Caesar said. I gave him two one-dollar bills. As I handed them to him, I noticed that one had been torn in half and fixed with a piece of blue paper. Also, the upper right hand corner was missing.

Azalea Adair herself opened the door when I knocked. She was about fifty years old. Her white hair was pulled back from her small, tired face. She wore a pale yellow dress. It was old, but very clean.

Azalea Adair led me into her living room. A damaged table, three chairs and an old red sofa were in the center of the floor.

Azalea Adair and I sat down at the table and began to talk. I told her about the magazines offer and she told me about herself. She was from an old southern family. Her father had been a judge.

Azalea Adair told me she had never traveled or even attended school. Her parents taught her at home with private teachers. We finished our meeting. I promised to return with the agreement the next day, and rose to leave.

At that moment, someone knocked at the back door. Azalea Adair whispered a soft apology and went to answer the caller. She came back a minute later with bright eyes and pink cheeks. She looked ten years younger.  "You must have a cup of tea before you go," she said. She shook a little bell on the table, and a small black girl about twelve years old ran into the room.

Azalea Aair opened a tiny old purse and took out a dollar bill. It had been fixed with a piece of blue paper and the upper right hand corner was missing. It was the dollar I had given to Uncle Caesar. "Go to Mr. Bakers store, Impy," she said, "and get me twenty-five cents worth of tea and ten cents worth of sugar cakes. And please hurry."

The child ran out of the room. We heard the back door close. Then the girl screamed. Her cry mixed with a mans angry voice. Azalea Adair stood up. Her face showed no emotion as she left the room. I heard the mans rough voice and her gentle one. Then a door slammed and she came back into the room.

"I am sorry, but I wont be able to offer you any tea after all," she said. "It seems that Mr. Baker has no more tea. Perhaps he will find some for our visit tomorrow."

We said good-bye. I went back to my hotel.

Just before dinner, Major Wentworth Caswell found me. It was impossible to avoid him. He insisted on buying me a drink and pulled two one-dollar bills from his pocket. Again I saw a torn dollar fixed with blue paper, with a corner missing. It was the one I gave Uncle Caesar. How strange, I thought. I wondered how Caswell got it.

Uncle Caesar was waiting outside the hotel the next afternoon. He took me to Miss Adairs house and agreed to wait there until we had finished our business.

Azalea Adair did not look well. I explained the agreement to her. She signed it. Then, as she started to rise from the table, Azalea Adair fainted and fell to the floor. I picked her up and carried her to the old red sofa. I ran to the door and yelled to Uncle Caesar for help. He ran down the street. Five minutes later, he was back with a doctor.

The doctor examined Miss Adair and turned to the old black driver. "Uncle Caesar," he said, "run to my house and ask my wife for some milk and some eggs. Hurry!"

Then the doctor turned to me. "She does not get enough to eat," he said. "She has many friends who want to help her, but she is proud. Misses Caswell will accept help only from that old black man. He was once her familys slave."

"Misses Caswell." I said in surprise. "I thought she was Azalea Adair."

"She was," the doctor answered, "until she married Wentworth Caswell twenty years ago. But hes a hopeless drunk who takes even the small amount of money that Uncle Caesar gives her."

After the doctor left I heard Caesars voice in the other room. "Did he take all the money I gave you yesterday, Miss Azalea?"  "Yes, Caesar," I heard her answer softly. "He took both dollars."

I went into the room and gave Azalea Adair fifty dollars. I told her it was from the magazine. Then Uncle Caesar drove me back to the hotel.

A few hours later, I went out for a walk before dinner. A crowd of people were talking excitedly in front of a store. I pushed my way into the store. Major Caswell was lying on the floor. He was dead.

Someone had found his body on the street. He had been killed in a fight. In fact, his hands were still closed into tight fists. But as I stood near his body, Caswells right hand opened. Something fell from it and rolled near my feet. I put my foot on it, then picked it up and put it in my pocket.

People said they believed a thief had killed him. They said Caswell had been showing everyone that he had fifty dollars. But when he was found, he had no money on him.

I left Nashville the next morning. As the train crossed a river I took out of my pocket the object that had dropped from Caswells dead hand. I threw it into the river below.

It was a button. A yellow button...the one from Uncle Caesars coat.

Story 3:
The old Indian was sitting on the snow. It was Koskoosh, former chief of his tribe. Now, all he could do was sit and listen to the others. His eyes were old.  He could not see, but his ears were wide open to every sound.

"Aha." That was the sound of his daughter, Sit-cum-to-ha.  She was beating the dogs, trying to make them stand in front of the snow sleds.  He was forgotten by her, and by the others, too. They had to look for new hunting grounds. The long, snowy ride waited. The days of the northlands were growing short. The tribe could not wait for death. Koskoosh was dying.

The stiff, crackling noises of frozen animal skins told him that the chief's tent was being torn down. The chief was a mighty hunter. He was his son, the son of Koskoosh.  Koskoosh was being left to die.

As the women worked, old Koskoosh could hear his son's voice drive them to work faster. He listened harder. It was the last time he would hear that voice. A child cried, and a woman sang softly to quiet it. The child was Koo-tee, the old man thought, a sickly child. It would die soon, and they would burn a hole in the frozen ground to bury it. They would cover its small body with stones to keep the wolves away.

"Well, what of it? A few years, and in the end, death. Death waited ever hungry. Death had the hungriest stomach of all."

Koskoosh listened to other sounds he would hear no more: the men tying strong leather rope around the sleds to hold their belongings; the sharp sounds of leather whips, ordering the dogs to move and pull the sleds.

"Listen to the dogs cry. How they hated the work."

They were off.  Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life.  He must meet his last hour alone.

"But what was that?" The snow packed down hard under someone's shoes. A man stood beside him, and placed a hand gently on his old head. His son was good to do this. He remembered other old men whose sons had not done this, who had left without a goodbye.

His mind traveled into the past until his son's voice brought him back.  "It is well with you?" his son asked. And the old man answered, "It is well."

"There is wood next to you and the fire burns bright," the son said. "The morning is gray and the cold is here. It will snow soon.  Even now it is snowing. Ahh, even now it is snowing.

"The tribesmen hurry. Their loads are heavy and their stomachs flat from little food. The way is long and they travel fast. I go now. All is well?"

"It is well. I am as last year's leaf that sticks to the tree. The first breath that blows will knock me to the ground. My voice is like an old woman's. My eyes no longer show me the way my feet go. I am tired and all is well."

He lowered his head to his chest and listened to the snow as his son rode away. He felt the sticks of wood next to him again. One by one, the fire would eat them.  And step by step, death would cover him. When the last stick was gone, the cold would come. First, his feet would freeze. Then, his hands. The cold would travel slowly from the outside to the inside of him, and he would rest. It was easy…all men must die.

He felt sorrow, but he did not think of his sorrow.  It was the way of life.  He had lived close to the earth, and the law was not new to him.  It was the law of the body.  Nature was not kind to the body.  She was not thoughtful of the person alone.  She was interested only in the group, the race, the species.

This was a deep thought for old Koskoosh. He had seen examples of it in all his life. The tree sap in early spring; the new-born green leaf, soft and fresh as skin; the fall of the yellowed, dry leaf. In this alone was all history.

He placed another stick on the fire and began to remember his past. He had been a great chief, too. He had seen days of much food and laughter; fat stomachs when food was left to rot and spoil; times when they left animals alone, unkilled; days when women had many children.  And he had seen days of no food and empty stomachs, days when the fish did not come, and the animals were hard to find.

For seven years the animals did not come. Then, he remembered when as a small boy how he watched the wolves kill a moose. He was with his friend Zing-ha, who was killed later in the Yukon River.

Ah, but the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out to play that day.  Down by the river they saw fresh steps of a big, heavy moose.  "He's an old one," Zing-ha had said.  "He cannot run like the others. He has fallen behind. The wolves have separated him from the others. They will never leave him."

And so it was. By day and night, never stopping, biting at his nose, biting at his feet, the wolves stayed with him until the end.

Zing-ha and he had felt the blood quicken in their bodies. The end would be a sight to see.

They had followed the steps of the moose and the wolves.  Each step told a different story.  They could see the tragedy as it happened: here was the place the moose stopped to fight.  The snow was packed down for many feet. One wolf had been caught by the heavy feet of the moose and kicked to death.  Further on, they saw how the moose had struggled to escape up a hill.  But the wolves had attacked from behind.  The moose had fallen down and crushed two wolves. Yet, it was clear the end was near.

The snow was red ahead of them. Then they heard the sounds of battle.  He and Zing-ha moved closer, on their stomachs, so the wolves would not see them.  They saw the end. The picture was so strong it had stayed with him all his life.  His dull, blind eyes saw the end again as they had in the far off past.

For long, his mind saw his past. The fire began to die out, and the cold entered his body.  He placed two more sticks on it, just two more left. This would be how long he would live.

It was very lonely. He placed one of the last pieces of wood on the fire.  Listen, what a strange noise for wood to make in the fire.  No, it wasn't wood.  His body shook as he recognized the sound…wolves.

The cry of a wolf brought the picture of the old moose back to him again.  He saw the body torn to pieces, with fresh blood running on the snow.  He saw the clean bones lying gray against the frozen blood.  He saw the rushing forms of the gray wolves, their shinning eyes, their long wet tongues and sharp teeth.  And he saw them form a circle and move ever slowly closer and closer.

A cold, wet nose touched his face.  At the touch, his soul jumped forward to awaken him. His hand went to the fire and he pulled a burning stick from it.  The wolf saw the fire, but was not afraid.  It turned and howled into the air to his brother wolves. They answered with hunger in their throats, and came running.

The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves.  He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire.  He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away.  Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man's strength.  Another and another followed.  The circle grew smaller and smaller.  Not one wolf stayed behind.

Why should he fight?  Why cling to life?  And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it.  It fell in the snow and the light went out.

The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came.  He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all?  Isn't this the law of life?

The stiff, crackling noises of frozen animal skins told him that the chief's tent was being torn down. The chief was a mighty hunter. He was his son, the son of Koskoosh.  Koskoosh was being left to die.

As the women worked, old Koskoosh could hear his son's voice drive them to work faster. He listened harder. It was the last time he would hear that voice. A child cried, and a woman sang softly to quiet it. The child was Koo-tee, the old man thought, a sickly child. It would die soon, and they would burn a hole in the frozen ground to bury it. They would cover its small body with stones to keep the wolves away.

"Well, what of it? A few years, and in the end, death. Death waited ever hungry. Death had the hungriest stomach of all."

Koskoosh listened to other sounds he would hear no more: the men tying strong leather rope around the sleds to hold their belongings; the sharp sounds of leather whips, ordering the dogs to move and pull the sleds.

"Listen to the dogs cry. How they hated the work."

They were off.  Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life.  He must meet his last hour alone.

"But what was that?" The snow packed down hard under someone's shoes. A man stood beside him, and placed a hand gently on his old head. His son was good to do this. He remembered other old men whose sons had not done this, who had left without a goodbye.

His mind traveled into the past until his son's voice brought him back.  "It is well with you?" his son asked. And the old man answered, "It is well."

"There is wood next to you and the fire burns bright," the son said. "The morning is gray and the cold is here. It will snow soon.  Even now it is snowing. Ahh, even now it is snowing.

"The tribesmen hurry. Their loads are heavy and their stomachs flat from little food. The way is long and they travel fast. I go now. All is well?"

"It is well. I am as last year's leaf that sticks to the tree. The first breath that blows will knock me to the ground. My voice is like an old woman's. My eyes no longer show me the way my feet go. I am tired and all is well."

He lowered his head to his chest and listened to the snow as his son rode away. He felt the sticks of wood next to him again. One by one, the fire would eat them.  And step by step, death would cover him. When the last stick was gone, the cold would come. First, his feet would freeze. Then, his hands. The cold would travel slowly from the outside to the inside of him, and he would rest. It was easy…all men must die.

He felt sorrow, but he did not think of his sorrow.  It was the way of life.  He had lived close to the earth, and the law was not new to him.  It was the law of the body.  Nature was not kind to the body.  She was not thoughtful of the person alone.  She was interested only in the group, the race, the species.

This was a deep thought for old Koskoosh. He had seen examples of it in all his life. The tree sap in early spring; the new-born green leaf, soft and fresh as skin; the fall of the yellowed, dry leaf. In this alone was all history.

He placed another stick on the fire and began to remember his past. He had been a great chief, too. He had seen days of much food and laughter; fat stomachs when food was left to rot and spoil; times when they left animals alone, unkilled; days when women had many children.  And he had seen days of no food and empty stomachs, days when the fish did not come, and the animals were hard to find.

For seven years the animals did not come. Then, he remembered when as a small boy how he watched the wolves kill a moose. He was with his friend Zing-ha, who was killed later in the Yukon River.

Ah, but the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out to play that day.  Down by the river they saw fresh steps of a big, heavy moose.  "He's an old one," Zing-ha had said.  "He cannot run like the others. He has fallen behind. The wolves have separated him from the others. They will never leave him."

And so it was. By day and night, never stopping, biting at his nose, biting at his feet, the wolves stayed with him until the end.

Zing-ha and he had felt the blood quicken in their bodies. The end would be a sight to see.

They had followed the steps of the moose and the wolves.  Each step told a different story.  They could see the tragedy as it happened: here was the place the moose stopped to fight.  The snow was packed down for many feet. One wolf had been caught by the heavy feet of the moose and kicked to death.  Further on, they saw how the moose had struggled to escape up a hill.  But the wolves had attacked from behind.  The moose had fallen down and crushed two wolves. Yet, it was clear the end was near.

The snow was red ahead of them. Then they heard the sounds of battle.  He and Zing-ha moved closer, on their stomachs, so the wolves would not see them.  They saw the end. The picture was so strong it had stayed with him all his life.  His dull, blind eyes saw the end again as they had in the far off past.

For long, his mind saw his past. The fire began to die out, and the cold entered his body.  He placed two more sticks on it, just two more left. This would be how long he would live.

It was very lonely. He placed one of the last pieces of wood on the fire.  Listen, what a strange noise for wood to make in the fire.  No, it wasn't wood.  His body shook as he recognized the sound…wolves.

The cry of a wolf brought the picture of the old moose back to him again.  He saw the body torn to pieces, with fresh blood running on the snow.  He saw the clean bones lying gray against the frozen blood.  He saw the rushing forms of the gray wolves, their shinning eyes, their long wet tongues and sharp teeth.  And he saw them form a circle and move ever slowly closer and closer.

A cold, wet nose touched his face.  At the touch, his soul jumped forward to awaken him. His hand went to the fire and he pulled a burning stick from it.  The wolf saw the fire, but was not afraid.  It turned and howled into the air to his brother wolves. They answered with hunger in their throats, and came running.

The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves.  He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire.  He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away.  Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man's strength.  Another and another followed.  The circle grew smaller and smaller.  Not one wolf stayed behind.

Why should he fight?  Why cling to life?  And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it.  It fell in the snow and the light went out.

The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came.  He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all?  Isn't this the law of life?

The old Indian was sitting on the snow. It was Koskoosh, former chief of his tribe. Now, all he could do was sit and listen to the others. His eyes were old.  He could not see, but his ears were wide open to every sound.

They were off.  Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life.  He must meet his last hour alone.

"But what was that?" The snow packed down hard under someone's shoes. A man stood beside him, and placed a hand gently on his old head. His son was good to do this. He remembered other old men whose sons had not done this, who had left without a goodbye.

His mind traveled into the past until his son's voice brought him back.  "It is well with you?" his son asked. And the old man answered, "It is well."

"There is wood next to you and the fire burns bright," the son said. "The morning is gray and the cold is here. It will snow soon.  Even now it is snowing. Ahh, even now it is snowing.

"The tribesmen hurry. Their loads are heavy and their stomachs flat from little food. The way is long and they travel fast. I go now. All is well?"

"It is well. I am as last year's leaf that sticks to the tree. The first breath that blows will knock me to the ground. My voice is like an old woman's. My eyes no longer show me the way my feet go. I am tired and all is well."

He lowered his head to his chest and listened to the snow as his son rode away. He felt the sticks of wood next to him again. One by one, the fire would eat them.  And step by step, death would cover him. When the last stick was gone, the cold would come. First, his feet would freeze. Then, his hands. The cold would travel slowly from the outside to the inside of him, and he would rest. It was easy…all men must die.

He felt sorrow, but he did not think of his sorrow.  It was the way of life.  He had lived close to the earth, and the law was not new to him.  It was the law of the body.  Nature was not kind to the body.  She was not thoughtful of the person alone.  She was interested only in the group, the race, the species.

This was a deep thought for old Koskoosh. He had seen examples of it in all his life. The tree sap in early spring; the new-born green leaf, soft and fresh as skin; the fall of the yellowed, dry leaf. In this alone was all history.

He placed another stick on the fire and began to remember his past. He had been a great chief, too. He had seen days of much food and laughter; fat stomachs when food was left to rot and spoil; times when they left animals alone, unkilled; days when women had many children.  And he had seen days of no food and empty stomachs, days when the fish did not come, and the animals were hard to find.

For seven years the animals did not come. Then, he remembered when as a small boy how he watched the wolves kill a moose. He was with his friend Zing-ha, who was killed later in the Yukon River.

Ah, but the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out to play that day.  Down by the river they saw fresh steps of a big, heavy moose.  "He's an old one," Zing-ha had said.  "He cannot run like the others. He has fallen behind. The wolves have separated him from the others. They will never leave him."

And so it was. By day and night, never stopping, biting at his nose, biting at his feet, the wolves stayed with him until the end.

Zing-ha and he had felt the blood quicken in their bodies. The end would be a sight to see.

They had followed the steps of the moose and the wolves.  Each step told a different story.  They could see the tragedy as it happened: here was the place the moose stopped to fight.  The snow was packed down for many feet. One wolf had been caught by the heavy feet of the moose and kicked to death.  Further on, they saw how the moose had struggled to escape up a hill.  But the wolves had attacked from behind.  The moose had fallen down and crushed two wolves. Yet, it was clear the end was near.

The snow was red ahead of them. Then they heard the sounds of battle.  He and Zing-ha moved closer, on their stomachs, so the wolves would not see them.  They saw the end. The picture was so strong it had stayed with him all his life.  His dull, blind eyes saw the end again as they had in the far off past.

For long, his mind saw his past. The fire began to die out, and the cold entered his body.  He placed two more sticks on it, just two more left. This would be how long he would live.

It was very lonely. He placed one of the last pieces of wood on the fire.  Listen, what a strange noise for wood to make in the fire.  No, it wasn't wood.  His body shook as he recognized the sound…wolves.

The cry of a wolf brought the picture of the old moose back to him again.  He saw the body torn to pieces, with fresh blood running on the snow.  He saw the clean bones lying gray against the frozen blood.  He saw the rushing forms of the gray wolves, their shinning eyes, their long wet tongues and sharp teeth.  And he saw them form a circle and move ever slowly closer and closer.

A cold, wet nose touched his face.  At the touch, his soul jumped forward to awaken him. His hand went to the fire and he pulled a burning stick from it.  The wolf saw the fire, but was not afraid.  It turned and howled into the air to his brother wolves. They answered with hunger in their throats, and came running.

The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves.  He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire.  He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away.  Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man's strength.  Another and another followed.  The circle grew smaller and smaller.  Not one wolf stayed behind.

Why should he fight?  Why cling to life?  And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it.  It fell in the snow and the light went out.

The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came.  He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all?  Isn't this the law of life?

The old Indian was sitting on the snow. It was Koskoosh, former chief of his tribe. Now, all he could do was sit and listen to the others. His eyes were old.  He could not see, but his ears were wide open to every sound.

"Aha." That was the sound of his daughter, Sit-cum-to-ha.  She was beating the dogs, trying to make them stand in front of the snow sleds.  He was forgotten by her, and by the others, too. They had to look for new hunting grounds. The long, snowy ride waited. The days of the northlands were growing short. The tribe could not wait for death. Koskoosh was dying.

The stiff, crackling noises of frozen animal skins told him that the chief's tent was being torn down. The chief was a mighty hunter. He was his son, the son of Koskoosh.  Koskoosh was being left to die.

As the women worked, old Koskoosh could hear his son's voice drive them to work faster. He listened harder. It was the last time he would hear that voice. A child cried, and a woman sang softly to quiet it. The child was Koo-tee, the old man thought, a sickly child. It would die soon, and they would burn a hole in the frozen ground to bury it. They would cover its small body with stones to keep the wolves away.

"Well, what of it? A few years, and in the end, death. Death waited ever hungry. Death had the hungriest stomach of all."

Koskoosh listened to other sounds he would hear no more: the men tying strong leather rope around the sleds to hold their belongings; the sharp sounds of leather whips, ordering the dogs to move and pull the sleds.

"Listen to the dogs cry. How they hated the work."

They were off.  Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life.  He must meet his last hour alone.

He lowered his head to his chest and listened to the snow as his son rode away. He felt the sticks of wood next to him again. One by one, the fire would eat them.  And step by step, death would cover him. When the last stick was gone, the cold would come. First, his feet would freeze. Then, his hands. The cold would travel slowly from the outside to the inside of him, and he would rest. It was easy…all men must die.

He felt sorrow, but he did not think of his sorrow.  It was the way of life.  He had lived close to the earth, and the law was not new to him.  It was the law of the body.  Nature was not kind to the body.  She was not thoughtful of the person alone.  She was interested only in the group, the race, the species.

This was a deep thought for old Koskoosh. He had seen examples of it in all his life. The tree sap in early spring; the new-born green leaf, soft and fresh as skin; the fall of the yellowed, dry leaf. In this alone was all history.

He placed another stick on the fire and began to remember his past. He had been a great chief, too. He had seen days of much food and laughter; fat stomachs when food was left to rot and spoil; times when they left animals alone, unkilled; days when women had many children.  And he had seen days of no food and empty stomachs, days when the fish did not come, and the animals were hard to find.

For seven years the animals did not come. Then, he remembered when as a small boy how he watched the wolves kill a moose. He was with his friend Zing-ha, who was killed later in the Yukon River.

Ah, but the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out to play that day.  Down by the river they saw fresh steps of a big, heavy moose.  "He's an old one," Zing-ha had said.  "He cannot run like the others. He has fallen behind. The wolves have separated him from the others. They will never leave him."

And so it was. By day and night, never stopping, biting at his nose, biting at his feet, the wolves stayed with him until the end.

Zing-ha and he had felt the blood quicken in their bodies. The end would be a sight to see.

They had followed the steps of the moose and the wolves.  Each step told a different story.  They could see the tragedy as it happened: here was the place the moose stopped to fight.  The snow was packed down for many feet. One wolf had been caught by the heavy feet of the moose and kicked to death.  Further on, they saw how the moose had struggled to escape up a hill.  But the wolves had attacked from behind.  The moose had fallen down and crushed two wolves. Yet, it was clear the end was near.

The snow was red ahead of them. Then they heard the sounds of battle.  He and Zing-ha moved closer, on their stomachs, so the wolves would not see them.  They saw the end. The picture was so strong it had stayed with him all his life.  His dull, blind eyes saw the end again as they had in the far off past.

For long, his mind saw his past. The fire began to die out, and the cold entered his body.  He placed two more sticks on it, just two more left. This would be how long he would live.

It was very lonely. He placed one of the last pieces of wood on the fire.  Listen, what a strange noise for wood to make in the fire.  No, it wasn't wood.  His body shook as he recognized the sound…wolves.

The cry of a wolf brought the picture of the old moose back to him again.  He saw the body torn to pieces, with fresh blood running on the snow.  He saw the clean bones lying gray against the frozen blood.  He saw the rushing forms of the gray wolves, their shinning eyes, their long wet tongues and sharp teeth.  And he saw them form a circle and move ever slowly closer and closer.

A cold, wet nose touched his face.  At the touch, his soul jumped forward to awaken him. His hand went to the fire and he pulled a burning stick from it.  The wolf saw the fire, but was not afraid.  It turned and howled into the air to his brother wolves. They answered with hunger in their throats, and came running.

The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves.  He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire.  He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away.  Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man's strength.  Another and another followed.  The circle grew smaller and smaller.  Not one wolf stayed behind.

Why should he fight?  Why cling to life?  And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it.  It fell in the snow and the light went out.

The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came.  He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all?  Isn't this the law of life?

ANNOUNCER: You have just heard the American story "The Law of Life."  It was written by Jack London. Your storyteller was Shep O'Neal.  Listen again next week for another American story in V.O.A. Special English. I'm Faith Lapidus.

The old Indian was sitting on the snow. It was Koskoosh, former chief of his tribe. Now, all he could do was sit and listen to the others. His eyes were old.  He could not see, but his ears were wide open to every sound.

"Aha." That was the sound of his daughter, Sit-cum-to-ha.  She was beating the dogs, trying to make them stand in front of the snow sleds.  He was forgotten by her, and by the others, too. They had to look for new hunting grounds. The long, snowy ride waited. The days of the northlands were growing short. The tribe could not wait for death. Koskoosh was dying.

The stiff, crackling noises of frozen animal skins told him that the chief's tent was being torn down. The chief was a mighty hunter. He was his son, the son of Koskoosh.  Koskoosh was being left to die.

As the women worked, old Koskoosh could hear his son's voice drive them to work faster. He listened harder. It was the last time he would hear that voice. A child cried, and a woman sang softly to quiet it. The child was Koo-tee, the old man thought, a sickly child. It would die soon, and they would burn a hole in the frozen ground to bury it. They would cover its small body with stones to keep the wolves away.

"Well, what of it? A few years, and in the end, death. Death waited ever hungry. Death had the hungriest stomach of all."

Koskoosh listened to other sounds he would hear no more: the men tying strong leather rope around the sleds to hold their belongings; the sharp sounds of leather whips, ordering the dogs to move and pull the sleds.

"Listen to the dogs cry. How they hated the work."

They were off.  Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life.  He must meet his last hour alone.

"But what was that?" The snow packed down hard under someone's shoes. A man stood beside him, and placed a hand gently on his old head. His son was good to do this. He remembered other old men whose sons had not done this, who had left without a goodbye.

His mind traveled into the past until his son's voice brought him back.  "It is well with you?" his son asked. And the old man answered, "It is well."

"There is wood next to you and the fire burns bright," the son said. "The morning is gray and the cold is here. It will snow soon.  Even now it is snowing. Ahh, even now it is snowing.

"The tribesmen hurry. Their loads are heavy and their stomachs flat from little food. The way is long and they travel fast. I go now. All is well?"

"It is well. I am as last year's leaf that sticks to the tree. The first breath that blows will knock me to the ground. My voice is like an old woman's. My eyes no longer show me the way my feet go. I am tired and all is well."

He placed another stick on the fire and began to remember his past. He had been a great chief, too. He had seen days of much food and laughter; fat stomachs when food was left to rot and spoil; times when they left animals alone, unkilled; days when women had many children.  And he had seen days of no food and empty stomachs, days when the fish did not come, and the animals were hard to find.

For seven years the animals did not come. Then, he remembered when as a small boy how he watched the wolves kill a moose. He was with his friend Zing-ha, who was killed later in the Yukon River.

Ah, but the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out to play that day.  Down by the river they saw fresh steps of a big, heavy moose.  "He's an old one," Zing-ha had said.  "He cannot run like the others. He has fallen behind. The wolves have separated him from the others. They will never leave him."

And so it was. By day and night, never stopping, biting at his nose, biting at his feet, the wolves stayed with him until the end.

Zing-ha and he had felt the blood quicken in their bodies. The end would be a sight to see.

They had followed the steps of the moose and the wolves.  Each step told a different story.  They could see the tragedy as it happened: here was the place the moose stopped to fight.  The snow was packed down for many feet. One wolf had been caught by the heavy feet of the moose and kicked to death.  Further on, they saw how the moose had struggled to escape up a hill.  But the wolves had attacked from behind.  The moose had fallen down and crushed two wolves. Yet, it was clear the end was near.

The snow was red ahead of them. Then they heard the sounds of battle.  He and Zing-ha moved closer, on their stomachs, so the wolves would not see them.  They saw the end. The picture was so strong it had stayed with him all his life.  His dull, blind eyes saw the end again as they had in the far off past.

For long, his mind saw his past. The fire began to die out, and the cold entered his body.  He placed two more sticks on it, just two more left. This would be how long he would live.

It was very lonely. He placed one of the last pieces of wood on the fire.  Listen, what a strange noise for wood to make in the fire.  No, it wasn't wood.  His body shook as he recognized the sound…wolves.

The cry of a wolf brought the picture of the old moose back to him again.  He saw the body torn to pieces, with fresh blood running on the snow.  He saw the clean bones lying gray against the frozen blood.  He saw the rushing forms of the gray wolves, their shinning eyes, their long wet tongues and sharp teeth.  And he saw them form a circle and move ever slowly closer and closer.

A cold, wet nose touched his face.  At the touch, his soul jumped forward to awaken him. His hand went to the fire and he pulled a burning stick from it.  The wolf saw the fire, but was not afraid.  It turned and howled into the air to his brother wolves. They answered with hunger in their throats, and came running.

The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves.  He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire.  He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away.  Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man's strength.  Another and another followed.  The circle grew smaller and smaller.  Not one wolf stayed behind.

Why should he fight?  Why cling to life?  And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it.  It fell in the snow and the light went out.

The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came.  He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all?  Isn't this the law of life?

ANNOUNCER: You have just heard the American story "The Law of Life."  It was written by Jack London. Your storyteller was Shep O'Neal.  Listen again next week for another American story in V.O.A. Special English. I'm Faith Lapidus.

The old Indian was sitting on the snow. It was Koskoosh, former chief of his tribe. Now, all he could do was sit and listen to the others. His eyes were old.  He could not see, but his ears were wide open to every sound.

"Aha." That was the sound of his daughter, Sit-cum-to-ha.  She was beating the dogs, trying to make them stand in front of the snow sleds.  He was forgotten by her, and by the others, too. They had to look for new hunting grounds. The long, snowy ride waited. The days of the northlands were growing short. The tribe could not wait for death. Koskoosh was dying.

The stiff, crackling noises of frozen animal skins told him that the chief's tent was being torn down. The chief was a mighty hunter. He was his son, the son of Koskoosh.  Koskoosh was being left to die.

As the women worked, old Koskoosh could hear his son's voice drive them to work faster. He listened harder. It was the last time he would hear that voice. A child cried, and a woman sang softly to quiet it. The child was Koo-tee, the old man thought, a sickly child. It would die soon, and they would burn a hole in the frozen ground to bury it. They would cover its small body with stones to keep the wolves away.

"Well, what of it? A few years, and in the end, death. Death waited ever hungry. Death had the hungriest stomach of all."

Koskoosh listened to other sounds he would hear no more: the men tying strong leather rope around the sleds to hold their belongings; the sharp sounds of leather whips, ordering the dogs to move and pull the sleds.

"Listen to the dogs cry. How they hated the work."

They were off.  Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life.  He must meet his last hour alone.

"But what was that?" The snow packed down hard under someone's shoes. A man stood beside him, and placed a hand gently on his old head. His son was good to do this. He remembered other old men whose sons had not done this, who had left without a goodbye.

His mind traveled into the past until his son's voice brought him back.  "It is well with you?" his son asked. And the old man answered, "It is well."

"There is wood next to you and the fire burns bright," the son said. "The morning is gray and the cold is here. It will snow soon.  Even now it is snowing. Ahh, even now it is snowing.

"The tribesmen hurry. Their loads are heavy and their stomachs flat from little food. The way is long and they travel fast. I go now. All is well?"

"It is well. I am as last year's leaf that sticks to the tree. The first breath that blows will knock me to the ground. My voice is like an old woman's. My eyes no longer show me the way my feet go. I am tired and all is well."

He lowered his head to his chest and listened to the snow as his son rode away. He felt the sticks of wood next to him again. One by one, the fire would eat them.  And step by step, death would cover him. When the last stick was gone, the cold would come. First, his feet would freeze. Then, his hands. The cold would travel slowly from the outside to the inside of him, and he would rest. It was easy…all men must die.

He felt sorrow, but he did not think of his sorrow.  It was the way of life.  He had lived close to the earth, and the law was not new to him.  It was the law of the body.  Nature was not kind to the body.  She was not thoughtful of the person alone.  She was interested only in the group, the race, the species.

Zing-ha and he had felt the blood quicken in their bodies. The end would be a sight to see.

They had followed the steps of the moose and the wolves.  Each step told a different story.  They could see the tragedy as it happened: here was the place the moose stopped to fight.  The snow was packed down for many feet. One wolf had been caught by the heavy feet of the moose and kicked to death.  Further on, they saw how the moose had struggled to escape up a hill.  But the wolves had attacked from behind.  The moose had fallen down and crushed two wolves. Yet, it was clear the end was near.

The snow was red ahead of them. Then they heard the sounds of battle.  He and Zing-ha moved closer, on their stomachs, so the wolves would not see them.  They saw the end. The picture was so strong it had stayed with him all his life.  His dull, blind eyes saw the end again as they had in the far off past.

For long, his mind saw his past. The fire began to die out, and the cold entered his body.  He placed two more sticks on it, just two more left. This would be how long he would live.

It was very lonely. He placed one of the last pieces of wood on the fire.  Listen, what a strange noise for wood to make in the fire.  No, it wasn't wood.  His body shook as he recognized the sound…wolves.

The cry of a wolf brought the picture of the old moose back to him again.  He saw the body torn to pieces, with fresh blood running on the snow.  He saw the clean bones lying gray against the frozen blood.  He saw the rushing forms of the gray wolves, their shinning eyes, their long wet tongues and sharp teeth.  And he saw them form a circle and move ever slowly closer and closer.

A cold, wet nose touched his face.  At the touch, his soul jumped forward to awaken him. His hand went to the fire and he pulled a burning stick from it.  The wolf saw the fire, but was not afraid.  It turned and howled into the air to his brother wolves. They answered with hunger in their throats, and came running.

The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves.  He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire.  He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away.  Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man's strength.  Another and another followed.  The circle grew smaller and smaller.  Not one wolf stayed behind.

Why should he fight?  Why cling to life?  And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it.  It fell in the snow and the light went out.

The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came.  He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all?  Isn't this the law of life?

ANNOUNCER: You have just heard the American story "The Law of Life."  It was written by Jack London. Your storyteller was Shep O'Neal.  Listen again next week for another American story in V.O.A. Special English. I'm Faith Lapidus.

The old Indian was sitting on the snow. It was Koskoosh, former chief of his tribe. Now, all he could do was sit and listen to the others. His eyes were old.  He could not see, but his ears were wide open to every sound.

"Aha." That was the sound of his daughter, Sit-cum-to-ha.  She was beating the dogs, trying to make them stand in front of the snow sleds.  He was forgotten by her, and by the others, too. They had to look for new hunting grounds. The long, snowy ride waited. The days of the northlands were growing short. The tribe could not wait for death. Koskoosh was dying.

The stiff, crackling noises of frozen animal skins told him that the chief's tent was being torn down. The chief was a mighty hunter. He was his son, the son of Koskoosh.  Koskoosh was being left to die.

As the women worked, old Koskoosh could hear his son's voice drive them to work faster. He listened harder. It was the last time he would hear that voice. A child cried, and a woman sang softly to quiet it. The child was Koo-tee, the old man thought, a sickly child. It would die soon, and they would burn a hole in the frozen ground to bury it. They would cover its small body with stones to keep the wolves away.

"Well, what of it? A few years, and in the end, death. Death waited ever hungry. Death had the hungriest stomach of all."

Koskoosh listened to other sounds he would hear no more: the men tying strong leather rope around the sleds to hold their belongings; the sharp sounds of leather whips, ordering the dogs to move and pull the sleds.

"Listen to the dogs cry. How they hated the work."

They were off.  Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life.  He must meet his last hour alone.

"But what was that?" The snow packed down hard under someone's shoes. A man stood beside him, and placed a hand gently on his old head. His son was good to do this. He remembered other old men whose sons had not done this, who had left without a goodbye.

His mind traveled into the past until his son's voice brought him back.  "It is well with you?" his son asked. And the old man answered, "It is well."

"There is wood next to you and the fire burns bright," the son said. "The morning is gray and the cold is here. It will snow soon.  Even now it is snowing. Ahh, even now it is snowing.

"The tribesmen hurry. Their loads are heavy and their stomachs flat from little food. The way is long and they travel fast. I go now. All is well?"

"It is well. I am as last year's leaf that sticks to the tree. The first breath that blows will knock me to the ground. My voice is like an old woman's. My eyes no longer show me the way my feet go. I am tired and all is well."

He lowered his head to his chest and listened to the snow as his son rode away. He felt the sticks of wood next to him again. One by one, the fire would eat them.  And step by step, death would cover him. When the last stick was gone, the cold would come. First, his feet would freeze. Then, his hands. The cold would travel slowly from the outside to the inside of him, and he would rest. It was easy…all men must die.

He felt sorrow, but he did not think of his sorrow.  It was the way of life.  He had lived close to the earth, and the law was not new to him.  It was the law of the body.  Nature was not kind to the body.  She was not thoughtful of the person alone.  She was interested only in the group, the race, the species.

This was a deep thought for old Koskoosh. He had seen examples of it in all his life. The tree sap in early spring; the new-born green leaf, soft and fresh as skin; the fall of the yellowed, dry leaf. In this alone was all history.

He placed another stick on the fire and began to remember his past. He had been a great chief, too. He had seen days of much food and laughter; fat stomachs when food was left to rot and spoil; times when they left animals alone, unkilled; days when women had many children.  And he had seen days of no food and empty stomachs, days when the fish did not come, and the animals were hard to find.

For seven years the animals did not come. Then, he remembered when as a small boy how he watched the wolves kill a moose. He was with his friend Zing-ha, who was killed later in the Yukon River.

Ah, but the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out to play that day.  Down by the river they saw fresh steps of a big, heavy moose.  "He's an old one," Zing-ha had said.  "He cannot run like the others. He has fallen behind. The wolves have separated him from the others. They will never leave him."

For long, his mind saw his past. The fire began to die out, and the cold entered his body.  He placed two more sticks on it, just two more left. This would be how long he would live.

It was very lonely. He placed one of the last pieces of wood on the fire.  Listen, what a strange noise for wood to make in the fire.  No, it wasn't wood.  His body shook as he recognized the sound…wolves.

The cry of a wolf brought the picture of the old moose back to him again.  He saw the body torn to pieces, with fresh blood running on the snow.  He saw the clean bones lying gray against the frozen blood.  He saw the rushing forms of the gray wolves, their shinning eyes, their long wet tongues and sharp teeth.  And he saw them form a circle and move ever slowly closer and closer.

A cold, wet nose touched his face.  At the touch, his soul jumped forward to awaken him. His hand went to the fire and he pulled a burning stick from it.  The wolf saw the fire, but was not afraid.  It turned and howled into the air to his brother wolves. They answered with hunger in their throats, and came running.

The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves.  He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire.  He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away.  Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man's strength.  Another and another followed.  The circle grew smaller and smaller.  Not one wolf stayed behind.

Why should he fight?  Why cling to life?  And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it.  It fell in the snow and the light went out.

The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came.  He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all?  Isn't this the law of life?

ANNOUNCER: You have just heard the American story "The Law of Life."  It was written by Jack London. Your storyteller was Shep O'Neal.  Listen again next week for another American story in V.O.A. Special English. I'm Faith Lapidus.

The old Indian was sitting on the snow. It was Koskoosh, former chief of his tribe. Now, all he could do was sit and listen to the others. His eyes were old.  He could not see, but his ears were wide open to every sound.

"Aha." That was the sound of his daughter, Sit-cum-to-ha.  She was beating the dogs, trying to make them stand in front of the snow sleds.  He was forgotten by her, and by the others, too. They had to look for new hunting grounds. The long, snowy ride waited. The days of the northlands were growing short. The tribe could not wait for death. Koskoosh was dying.

The stiff, crackling noises of frozen animal skins told him that the chief's tent was being torn down. The chief was a mighty hunter. He was his son, the son of Koskoosh.  Koskoosh was being left to die.

As the women worked, old Koskoosh could hear his son's voice drive them to work faster. He listened harder. It was the last time he would hear that voice. A child cried, and a woman sang softly to quiet it. The child was Koo-tee, the old man thought, a sickly child. It would die soon, and they would burn a hole in the frozen ground to bury it. They would cover its small body with stones to keep the wolves away.

"Well, what of it? A few years, and in the end, death. Death waited ever hungry. Death had the hungriest stomach of all."

Koskoosh listened to other sounds he would hear no more: the men tying strong leather rope around the sleds to hold their belongings; the sharp sounds of leather whips, ordering the dogs to move and pull the sleds.

"Listen to the dogs cry. How they hated the work."

They were off.  Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life.  He must meet his last hour alone.

"But what was that?" The snow packed down hard under someone's shoes. A man stood beside him, and placed a hand gently on his old head. His son was good to do this. He remembered other old men whose sons had not done this, who had left without a goodbye.

His mind traveled into the past until his son's voice brought him back.  "It is well with you?" his son asked. And the old man answered, "It is well."

"There is wood next to you and the fire burns bright," the son said. "The morning is gray and the cold is here. It will snow soon.  Even now it is snowing. Ahh, even now it is snowing.

"The tribesmen hurry. Their loads are heavy and their stomachs flat from little food. The way is long and they travel fast. I go now. All is well?"

"It is well. I am as last year's leaf that sticks to the tree. The first breath that blows will knock me to the ground. My voice is like an old woman's. My eyes no longer show me the way my feet go. I am tired and all is well."

He lowered his head to his chest and listened to the snow as his son rode away. He felt the sticks of wood next to him again. One by one, the fire would eat them.  And step by step, death would cover him. When the last stick was gone, the cold would come. First, his feet would freeze. Then, his hands. The cold would travel slowly from the outside to the inside of him, and he would rest. It was easy…all men must die.

He felt sorrow, but he did not think of his sorrow.  It was the way of life.  He had lived close to the earth, and the law was not new to him.  It was the law of the body.  Nature was not kind to the body.  She was not thoughtful of the person alone.  She was interested only in the group, the race, the species.

This was a deep thought for old Koskoosh. He had seen examples of it in all his life. The tree sap in early spring; the new-born green leaf, soft and fresh as skin; the fall of the yellowed, dry leaf. In this alone was all history.

He placed another stick on the fire and began to remember his past. He had been a great chief, too. He had seen days of much food and laughter; fat stomachs when food was left to rot and spoil; times when they left animals alone, unkilled; days when women had many children.  And he had seen days of no food and empty stomachs, days when the fish did not come, and the animals were hard to find.

For seven years the animals did not come. Then, he remembered when as a small boy how he watched the wolves kill a moose. He was with his friend Zing-ha, who was killed later in the Yukon River.

Ah, but the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out to play that day.  Down by the river they saw fresh steps of a big, heavy moose.  "He's an old one," Zing-ha had said.  "He cannot run like the others. He has fallen behind. The wolves have separated him from the others. They will never leave him."

And so it was. By day and night, never stopping, biting at his nose, biting at his feet, the wolves stayed with him until the end.

Zing-ha and he had felt the blood quicken in their bodies. The end would be a sight to see.

They had followed the steps of the moose and the wolves.  Each step told a different story.  They could see the tragedy as it happened: here was the place the moose stopped to fight.  The snow was packed down for many feet. One wolf had been caught by the heavy feet of the moose and kicked to death.  Further on, they saw how the moose had struggled to escape up a hill.  But the wolves had attacked from behind.  The moose had fallen down and crushed two wolves. Yet, it was clear the end was near.

The snow was red ahead of them. Then they heard the sounds of battle.  He and Zing-ha moved closer, on their stomachs, so the wolves would not see them.  They saw the end. The picture was so strong it had stayed with him all his life.  His dull, blind eyes saw the end again as they had in the far off past.

The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves.  He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire.  He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away.  Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man's strength.  Another and another followed.  The circle grew smaller and smaller.  Not one wolf stayed behind.

Why should he fight?  Why cling to life?  And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it.  It fell in the snow and the light went out.

The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came.  He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all?  Isn't this the law of life?
